# Algorithms from Scratch 

This personal project is aimed at attempting to write machine learning algorithms from scratch. The idea is to understand the challenges faced while applying the theory of ML to code and real datasets. 

Each of the algorithms can be divided into Regression and Classification type problem. 

Each algorithm folder contains 2 pythong files  
- .py file : This contains the created algorithm class 
- .ipynb file : This is a jupyter notebook that contains an example of using the algorithm and its methods.
